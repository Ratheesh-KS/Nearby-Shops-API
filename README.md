About Nearby Shops - How it Works ? 
-------------------------------

Nearby Shops is a distributed ecosystem of local markets conceptually similar to Mastadon project. Anyone can self-host their Local Market Instance and create their local market on Nearby Shops. The technology is fully open-source and funded by Donations. We dont charge any fee or comission in order to use the platform. 

Although the platform and technology is free but Service Providers (Market Creators) are allowed to charge for their services in order to recover their expenses and cost of human efforts and Man-Hours. You can make a reasonable middle-class income if your local market gets a decent enough traction. 

Local Market's are generally self-hosted by independent Volunteers, Service Providers and local vendor cooperatives who seek the welfare of their local vendors.

Nearby Shops helps you build your own local market for food delivery or Grocery delivery similar to Zomato, Swiggy, Dunzo, Grubhub and Rappi. This project comes with a comprehensive developer guide which makes it really easy and simple to start using this project. You dont even need to be a developer and just having basic knowledge of installing and working with software in enough for you.
